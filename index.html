        <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence is the future of trading. Over 95% of trades are done through quantum computing protocols designed to optimize and streamline trade execution. Immediate Edge is a pioneer in quantum computing and specializes in minifying or condensing incredibly complex strategies.</strong></p>
<ul class="list-check"><li>Immediate Edge is for skeptics! We love to to see the response on our member's faces every time their balance increases. We have managed to unlock secrets previously reserved for the super-wealthy, and now it's your turn to cash in on the action.</li><li>Practical engineering from top programmers specializing in trading automation. Immediate Edge employs quants or quantitative analysts that build thinking machines. The base of our statistical modeling is done through a custom OLAP cube. OLAP is online analytical processing, and it provides our data scientists with multi-dimensional data and insights. Simply put, there is a massive amount of data that is filtered and reassembled in a way which "makes sense". </li><li>Immediate Edge takes the guess-work out of trading. Our expert coders in the fields of programmatic computing and electrical engineering have somehow managed to rollout a trading automation protocol which literally puts to shame most of the big players in the online trading niche. This means you are in a unique position to take advantage of systems most people can only dream of these days. </li><li>Data science is our bread and butter! Programmatic computing is how we leverage trading opportunities on one hand, whilst on the other assess the constantly changing risk factors. Our programmers implement a "bottom-up" approach to research. That means the methodology is much more scientific, more optimized, and of course more profitable at the end of the day!<br>

    <p style="text-align: left;">The key to optimal performance in contract-based orders is proper machine learning and seamless execution of trades. The only way to do that is to hire the best coders and analysts, and let them build a machine that deciphers the secrets of market movements. This is done via predictive analysis, but also by collecting a massive amount of information and translating it into a statistical model which can be used as a&nbsp; formula for successful trading. This information is stored on secure servers which are located in our facilities in London, Singapore, Sydney, and Oman and can be reused for reverse-engineering and implementation of stop-loss features depending on the nature and quality of the data.</p>

              <p>Digital or online trading has grown exponentially, and this trend will not abate any time soon. Trading from home has more than quadrupled, and peaked after Covid-19 started spreading. All this is happening for a reason, and it has to do with the fact that many people are starting to gain access to more advanced trading tools after realizing the potential of trading online.</p>

Systems that were considered highly advanced are no longer adequate for today’s markets, and the only way to meet demand is by making software more accessible, cheaper, faster, and more user-friendly.</strong></p>
<p>Trading stocks or commodities by looking at charts or reading a newspaper is an outdated and almost naive way of purchasing contracts. People looking to make money in the markets are really searching for accurate and simple tools, as well as high profit margins.</p>
<p>This can’t be obtained by trying to figure out sophisticated spreadsheets which don’t really make sense. If you are in the market for a serious software with built-in technical indicators and real-time trading automation then Immediate Edge is the app you have been waiting for!</p>

      <p><strong>Powerful trading systems at your fingertips! That is not an overstatement or exaggeration, it’s a simple fact wish is constantly being proven every day. Our traders generate hundreds of thousands of dollars on a daily, and sometimes hourly basis. Part of our success has to do with our ability to allocate the best and most reliable, and certified CFD brokers to our members. </strong></p>
<p>These brokers are the liquidity providers which provide the actual trading arena as well as the cashier section of the software. Immediate Edge integrates with these trading platforms and acts as a kind of add-on or auxiliary system which latches on to the brokers and does the “heavy lifting” for its members.</p>
<p>Immediate Edge is AI at it’s finest! Have you heard of something called order types? Order types are sub-classifications used by the big investment houses like Goldman-Sachs and Citadel. These sub-classifications are in essence codes used by the big investment firms designed to give their super computers an edge over the competition. In other words there is a whole eco-system which is powered by advanced algorithms designed to provide whale investors with an edge and in that way secure their investments.</p>
<p>Immediate Edge identified these order types and follows the “bread crumbs” or signature they leave in&nbsp; the trading terminals. Then the app continues to mimic the trade while at the same time adding an additional layer of customized risk mitigation protocols.</p>
